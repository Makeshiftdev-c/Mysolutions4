**a**. There are real numbers whose sum is less than their difference; The statement would appear to be true. An example as such would be the case when *u* = 0, *v* = -1; whereby the sum would be less than the difference and the inequallity would be satisfied. The preceding is demostrated below:  
  
      *u* + *v* < *u* - *v* , when *u* = 0 and *v* = -1  
(0) + (-1) < (0) - (-1) ,  
       0 - 1 < 0 + 1 ,  
            -1 < 1 .
