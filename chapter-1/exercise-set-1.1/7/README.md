7. Rewrite the following statements less formally, without using variables. Determine, as best as you can, whether the statements are true or false.  
   **a**. There are real numbers *u* and *v* with the property that *u* + *v* < *u* - *v*.  
   **b**. There is a real number *x* such that *x*<sup>2</sup> < *x*.  
   **c**. For every positive integer *n*, *n*<sup>2</sup> &GreaterEqual; *n*.  
   **d**. For all real numbers *a* and *b*, |*a* + *b*| &leq; |*a*| + |*b*|.
